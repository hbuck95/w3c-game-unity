# w3c-game-unity
A short collaboration and team project with recent undergraduates at the University of Greenwich to develop to an interactive learning game aimed to educate players on aspects of the W3C principles.
Works developed by me can be found within the navigable, distinguishable, time-based-media, interfaces folders within the assets folders. A majority of the scripts within the global folder were also solely created by myself, including but not limited to: InteractionEvent, MouseBehaviour, QueryManager, DragUI, SceneLoader, RobotDialogue, and StandardManager.
